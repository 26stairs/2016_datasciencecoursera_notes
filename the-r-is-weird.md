## Weirdness in R

Some things I found confusing and/or hilarious and/or enraging:

 * `<-` is a pain to type (on American layouts, anyway).
 * `c(1,2,3)` and `c(1:3)` are different things.
 * Subsetting with `[...]` works differently on matrices than everywhere else.
 * `x + y` *does* something on vectors whose dimensions do not match.
 * `[1,2]` and `[[1,2]]` have completely different behaviour.
