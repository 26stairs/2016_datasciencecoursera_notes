# Notes for the Data Science specialization on Coursera (2016)

These are my notes for the Data Science specialization on Coursera (started January 2016).
I can not guarantee that they are completely accurate, as they are a filtered summary of the presented material with my interpretation and commentary.

To my knowledge, the notes contain no information directly related to any form of examination happening during the courses.

As far as it concerns pars that count as written by me,

Due to the nature of the material, many phrasing are taken more or less literally from the course materials, rights to which I do not own; they remain with the original authors.  
Graphics taken from the course material are explicitly marked as such.
