# Notes for the Data Science specialization on Coursera (2016)

These are my notes for the Data Science specialization on Coursera (started January 2016).
I can not guarantee that they are completely accurate as they are a filtered
summary of the presented material with my interpretation and commentary.
There are also augmentations from my own tinkering resp. research.

To the best of my knowledge, the notes contain no information directly
related to any form of examination happening during the courses.

The notes are organized by course:

 * [Data Scientist's Toolbox](01 Data Scientist's Toolbox/README.md)
 * [R Programming](02 R Programming/README.md)
 * [Getting and Cleaning Data](03 Getting and Cleaning Data/README.md)
 * [Exploratory Data Analysis](04 Exploratory Data Analysis/README.md)

Some additional material I compiled:

 * [Lessons learned from swirl](02 R Programming/lessons-swirl.md)
 * [From the book](from-the-book.md)(s)
 * [The R is weird](the-r-is-weird.md)

    I have collected some potential upsets or pitfalls of the R language for your enjoyment.
    Pull requests with rational explanations (target group: computer scientists, programmer)
    are appreciated.
